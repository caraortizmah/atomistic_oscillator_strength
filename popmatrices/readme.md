# Population analysis and transition intensities
### Here the atomistic oscillator strength is calculated and presented as heat map

Here notebooks take the outputs from the [x-ray_scripting_out](https://github.com/caraortizmah/x-ray_scripting_out) 
repository (name will be changed soon) and calculate the atomistic oscillator strength.

These notebooks initially were intented just for plotting **heat of maps** but as well, several equations were involved here.
These **equations** (including the atomistic oscillator strength) will be separated in another code for sake of simiplicity either running and programming.
