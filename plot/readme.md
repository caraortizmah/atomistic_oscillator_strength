# Post processing information after XAS calculation by ORCA
### XAS manipulation here
 `plot_pair_MW_xray.ipynb` is a first notebook for plotting XAS outputs from ORCA.
 This document is not cleaned and some of this data managing can be redundant.

 `plot_pair_FY_xray.ipynb` is a latest notebook version for plotting XAS outputs from ORCA.
 This document is cleaned and will be used to created new smaller version and to try to implement some visualization style from plotnine.
