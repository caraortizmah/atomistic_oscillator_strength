# atomistic_oscillator_strength
There are two folders for two part of the post processing data from the ORCA outputs

### plot/

Here all the notebooks are intented to plot XAS directly from the ORCA outputs

### pop_matrices/

Here notebooks take the outputs from the [x-ray_scripting_out](https://github.com/caraortizmah/x-ray_scripting_out) 
repository (name will be changed soon) and calculate the atomistic oscillator strength.
